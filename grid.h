 The grid object holds all of the necessary methods and
 data structures to input and solve the sudoku.
 The main data structure used is a 2D spare array of data
 objects that are dynamically allocated and set to point to
 each other, with the rest of the pointers set to nullptr.
 An array of columns is also held and linked to the data 
 matrix to allow the cover and uncover functions access to 
 the matrix.
 The column array is accessed through a special column object
 held by the grid called header. The header only uses its right
 and left pointers, respecively pointing to the beginning and 
 the end of the column array when the grid is initialized.
 The ouput array contains pointers that will be set during the
 recursion that point to members in the data matrix. Each pointer
 points to one of the members in each row, but as the row is the
 same for all pointers in each row it is irrelavent which object
 is pointed to in the output array. A size variable is also held
 within the grid object.
 Finally the maximum rows and the maximum columns for the data 
 matrix are held as constant variables.
